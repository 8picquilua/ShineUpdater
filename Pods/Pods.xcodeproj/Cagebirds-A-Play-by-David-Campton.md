Cagebirds is a one-act play by British playwright David Campton, first performed in 1972. The play explores the themes of conformity, freedom, and identity through the metaphor of caged birds. The plot revolves around a group of six women who live in a locked room, each with their own obsessive habits and quirks. They are visited by a mysterious Stranger, who claims to have escaped from another cage and tries to persuade them to join her. However, the other women are afraid of change and resist her attempts to liberate them.

The play is divided into two parts: the first part introduces the characters and their routines, while the second part shows the conflict between the Stranger and the others. The characters are named after their dominant traits: Guzzle (a glutton), Gazer (a narcissist), Gossip (a busybody), Twitting (a chatterbox), Thump (a bully), Sloth (a lazybones), and Stranger (an outsider). The play also features a voice-over by Mistress, who controls the women and provides them with food and water.
 
Cagebirds is a dark comedy that satirizes the human tendency to conform to social norms and resist change. The play also questions the meaning of freedom and happiness, as the women seem content with their cages despite their limitations. The play has been praised for its witty dialogue, clever symbolism, and powerful message.

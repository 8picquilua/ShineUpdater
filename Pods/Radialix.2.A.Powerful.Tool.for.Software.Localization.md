One of the features that makes Radialix 2 stand out is its ability to localize hard-coded strings in the application code. It can extract localizable resources directly from original files, allowing you to translate strings, dialogs, forms, menus and other resources in a user-friendly interface. It can also search for translation matches in the translated strings or in the translation memory, and automatically check the translation for errors[^4^].
 
Another feature that makes Radialix 2 unique is its integration with IDA, a popular disassembler and debugger. The installation package of Radialix 2 contains the RDMAP plug-in for IDA, which enables you to search and edit hard-coded strings with considerably better quality and efficiency. The plug-in can also handle cases where the string becomes longer after translation by carrying it over to the next section and correcting references to it automatically. It can also increase the length of a string by using byte-fillers at the end of a string[^5^].
